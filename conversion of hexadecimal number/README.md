# Hexadecimal to Binary Conversion – Mini Python Project

This Python program converts a given hexadecimal number into its equivalent binary number.  
It uses custom conversion logic by converting each hexadecimal digit to decimal and then to binary.

---

## Features

- Accepts hexadecimal number as input from the user
- Converts each character to its decimal equivalent
- Converts decimal to binary using a custom function
- Prints 4-bit formatted binary output for each hex digit
- Works for both numeric (0-9) and alphabetic (A-F) hex characters

---

## Concepts Used

- String and character processing
- ASCII conversions using `ord()`
- Custom decimal-to-binary conversion using repeated division
- Lists and loops (`for`, `while`)
- String concatenation and formatted printing

## How the Conversion Works

1. Read each hexadecimal character
2. Convert to decimal:
