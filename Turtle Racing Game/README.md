# Turtle Racing Game – Mini Python Project

This mini project uses Python's `turtle` graphics module to simulate a simple racing game between three turtles. Each turtle moves forward randomly, making the race unpredictable every time the program runs.

---

## Features

- Graphical animation using `turtle` module
- Random movement for each turtle to determine the race winner
- Visual race track drawn on the screen
- Three colored turtles representing racers

---

## Python Concepts Used

- Turtle graphics (`turtle` module)
- Random number generation (`random` module)
- Loops for movement and track creation
- Object creation with multiple turtle instances
- Screen positioning using `penup()`, `goto()`, etc.

---

## How the Program Works

1. A racing track is drawn using the turtle
2. Three turtles are placed at starting line with different colors
3. Inside a loop, each turtle moves forward by a random number of steps
4. The race ends when the loop completes, showing the final positions

## Requirements

- Python installed on system
- Turtle graphics supported by environment
